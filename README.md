# 🐱 CopyCat - The Purrfect Digital Doppelgänger

> *"Nine lives, one browser extension, zero f*cks given about detection algorithms."*

Welcome to **CopyCat**, the extension that makes AI detection software cry into their regex patterns. We've trained our digital feline to be so humanly imperfect, it's practically neurotic.

## 🕵️ What Fresh Hell Is This?

CopyCat is your personal AI assistant with commitment issues and a fake ID. It analyzes web forms with the precision of a caffeinated accountant, then fills them out with the typing rhythm of someone who's had *just* enough coffee to function but not enough to stop making typos.

**Translation for Humans:** It's ChatGPT's sneakier cousin who learned to type like you after three espressos and a mild existential crisis.

## ⚡ Features That'll Make You Question Your Life Choices

### 🎭 **Oscar-Worthy Performance**
- **Human Typing Simulation**: Includes realistic hesitation, backspacing, and that one finger that always hits the wrong key
- **Random Procrastination Breaks**: Sometimes it just... stops. Like a real human contemplating their mortality
- **Typo Generation**: Makes mistakes you would make (but fixes them because it's not *that* realistic)

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Form Analysis** 
- Reads web pages like a literature professor having a mental breakdown
- Understands context better than your therapist
- Provides answers more accurate than your friend who "totally read the article"

### 👻 **Stealth Mode Activated**
- Invisible to detection algorithms (we hope)
- Leaves digital fingerprints that look suspiciously human
- Types with the confidence of someone who definitely didn't Google the answer 2 seconds ago

### ⚡ **Lightning Fast Setup** *(If You Can Read Instructions)*
- Get a free Groq API key faster than you can say "existential dread"
- Choose from models with names that sound like rejected Pokémon
- Two keyboard shortcuts to rule them all
